# Real-media end-to-end evidence

Evidence date: 2026-11-07. Environment: Windows, CPython 3.12 x64, local FFmpeg build dated 2025-10-30. This record proves the direct single-folder media vertical slice only; it is not evidence for multi-worker scheduling, portable packaging, or timing accuracy.

## Fixture and outputs

- Source folder: `src_for_test/เหงาเหลือเกิน`
- Destination folder: `dest_for_test/เหงาเหลือเกิน`
- Run: `1e3b86267b7f465aab8ef0dd83540ae5`
- Output MP3: `song_with_cover.mp3`
- Output MP4: `karaoke.mp4`
- Production evidence: `production_data/manifest.json`, `qc_report.json`, `timing.json`, `karaoke.ass`

The single portrait image was explicitly authorized for both cover and video background. The source MP3 SHA-256 remained `be54051e1827e7a07e62a57c28d07ee4a1c0ae054706a575934a3adf35f604fc` after production.

## Verified results

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| MP3 source audio preserved | PASS — source/output MPEG audio payload SHA-256 both `d82fc07dfeee15a36305939510bf0b556f875b5fb23b71a53bbeb0f15529f253` |
| Embedded cover | PASS — one APIC frame; image hash matches input |
| MP4 decode | PASS — complete FFmpeg decode to null |
| MP4 streams | PASS — 1920x1080 H.264/yuv420p and AAC, duration 273.633333 s |
| Thai subtitle render | PASS — visual sample at 120 s rendered Thai text and active highlight |
| Automated suite | PASS — 57 tests; Ruff clean |

## Honest limitation

Lyrics were read from embedded ID3 text. Faster-whisper `base` supplied a vocal-time observation, after which lines were allocated proportionally. The run therefore records `SUCCEEDED_WITH_TEST_TIMING_OVERRIDE`, `review_required=true`, and `measured_alignment_kpi=false`. This output demonstrates executable E2E plumbing and valid media, not production-grade lyric synchronization.
